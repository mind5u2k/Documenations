API Gateway
1) Acts as an entry point for the requests.
2) Forward the requests to the downstream microservices
3) Commonly used in the distributed systems and microservices architecture.

Spring cloud Gateway:
This project provides a libraries for building an API Gateway on top of Spring WebFlux or Spring WebMVC.
Spring Cloud Gateway aims to provide a simple, yet effective way to route to APIs and provide cross cutting concerns to them such as: security, monitoring/metrics and resiliency.

Spring cloud Gateway features:
1) Build on Spring Framework and Spring Boot.
2) Able to match routes on any request attribute.
3) Predicates and filters are specific to routes.
4) Circuit Breaker integration
5) Spring Cloud DiscoveryClient integration
6) Easy to write Predicates and filters
7) Request Rate Limiting
8) Path Rewriting

Benifits of using API Gateway
1) Handles cross-cutting concers like
	- Security
	- Monitoring
	- Rate Limiting
	- SSL Termination
Drawbacks of using API Gateway
	- Increases complexity as we have to maintain yet another component in our system landscape.
	- Needs a lot of effor to maintain it as it will be a single point of failure - need to run multiple instances.
	- Increased latency for the client requests.
	





Struggling with Microservices in Interviews ?

These 10 Patterns Will Save You!

Before you step into that interview room, make sure you understand these 10 must-know microservices patterns as they could create the difference between landing the job or getting stuck on a tricky question! 👇

1️⃣ Service Registry & Discovery
=> Helps services find and communicate with each other dynamically.
🔧 Tools: Eureka, Consul

2️⃣ API Gateway
=> Acts as a single entry point, handling request routing, authentication, and load balancing.
🔧 Tools: Zuul, Spring Cloud Gateway

3️⃣ Circuit Breaker
=> Prevents system-wide failures by cutting off requests to struggling services.
🔧 Tools: Resilience4j, Hystrix

4️⃣ Database Per Service
=> Each microservice gets its own database to maintain data isolation and prevent tight coupling.

5️⃣ Saga Pattern
=> Manages distributed transactions across multiple services via orchestration or choreography.
🔧 Tools: Camunda, Temporal

6️⃣ Strangler Fig Pattern
=> A safe way to migrate from a monolith to microservices—gradually replacing pieces instead of a risky big bang rewrite.

7️⃣ Event Sourcing
=> Stores every state change as an event, allowing for historical tracking and easier debugging.

8️⃣ CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
=> Separates read and write operations for better scalability and performance.

9️⃣ Sidecar Pattern
=> Adds extra capabilities like logging, monitoring, or security without changing the main service.
🔧 Tools: Istio, Envoy

🔟 Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub)
=> Services communicate asynchronously, ensuring loose coupling and better scalability.
🔧 Tools: Kafka, RabbitMQ

🔑 Essential Microservices Interview Questions (and How to Answer Them Like a Pro) 🔑

As companies increasingly move towards microservices architecture, interviewers are keen to test candidates’ knowledge of its key principles and real-world application. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting to explore microservices, being well-prepared for these questions can set you apart.
Here are common microservices interview questions that you should be ready to answer, along with some tips on how to tackle them:
1. What are Microservices?
Answer Tip: Define microservices as a design approach where an application is broken down into smaller, independently deployable services. Each service performs a single business function and communicates with others through lightweight protocols (usually HTTP/REST).
2. What are the advantages of using microservices over monolithic architecture?
Answer Tip: Emphasize scalability, maintainability, independent deployment, fault isolation, and technology diversity as the key advantages.
3. What is service discovery in microservices?
Answer Tip: Explain that service discovery helps services find and communicate with each other dynamically, typically using tools like Eureka or Consul.
4. How do microservices communicate with each other?
Answer Tip: Discuss the use of RESTful APIs or gRPC, along with the possibility of asynchronous communication via message brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ.
5. What is API Gateway in microservices?
Answer Tip: An API Gateway acts as a reverse proxy to route requests to the appropriate microservices. It handles common tasks like authentication, rate limiting, and logging.
6. How do you manage inter-service communication?
Answer Tip: Talk about the use of synchronous communication (REST, gRPC) and asynchronous communication (message queues) depending on the use case.
7. How do you handle transactions in a microservices architecture?
Answer Tip: Discuss distributed transactions and patterns like SAGA or event sourcing for managing consistency across multiple services.
8. What are the challenges of microservices architecture?
Answer Tip: Mention challenges such as complexity in managing multiple services, network latency, data consistency, and service orchestration.
9. What is Circuit Breaker Pattern in microservices?
Answer Tip: The Circuit Breaker Pattern prevents a failure in one service from cascading to others. Tools like Hystrix or Resilience4j are commonly used to implement this pattern.
10. How do you ensure security in microservices?
Answer Tip: Explain strategies like OAuth2 for authorization, JWT for token-based authentication, and ensuring each service is stateless.
🎯 Pro Tip: When answering microservices-related interview questions, try to back up your responses with real-world examples from your projects. Show your practical knowledge by discussing
