API Gateway
1) Acts as an entry point for the requests.
2) Forward the requests to the downstream microservices
3) Commonly used in the distributed systems and microservices architecture.

Spring cloud Gateway:
This project provides a libraries for building an API Gateway on top of Spring WebFlux or Spring WebMVC.
Spring Cloud Gateway aims to provide a simple, yet effective way to route to APIs and provide cross cutting concerns to them such as: security, monitoring/metrics and resiliency.

Spring cloud Gateway features:
1) Build on Spring Framework and Spring Boot.
2) Able to match routes on any request attribute.
3) Predicates and filters are specific to routes.
4) Circuit Breaker integration
5) Spring Cloud DiscoveryClient integration
6) Easy to write Predicates and filters
7) Request Rate Limiting
8) Path Rewriting

Benifits of using API Gateway
	 nhgt6ghvb Handles cross-cutting concers like
	- Security
	- Monitoring
	- Rate Limiting
	- SSL Termination
Drawbacks of using API Gateway
	- Increases complexity as we have to maintain yet another component in our system landscape.
	- Needs a lot of effor to maintain it as it will be a single point of failure - need to run multiple instances.
	- Increased latency for the client requests.

Document REST API with Open API
	springdoc-openapi java library helps to automate the generation of API documentation using spring boot projects, springdoc-openapi works by examining an application at runtime 
	to infer API semantics based on spring configurations, class structures and various annotaions.
	Automatically generates documentation in JAON/YAML and HTML format APIs. This documentation can be completed by comments using swagger-api annotations.
