DSA a day can keep interview rejection away.

Yes practicing at least one question a day can help you crack any SDE interview.

I've compiled a collection of about 13 coding problem patterns that I think can be incredibly beneficial for anyone looking to grasp these powerful algorithmic techniques. 

1. Substring problem patterns:
