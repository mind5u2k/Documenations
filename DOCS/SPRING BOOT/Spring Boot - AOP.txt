Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) is a module in the Spring Framework that enables developers to manage cross-cutting concerns in a modular way. Cross-cutting concerns are aspects of a program that affect multiple parts of the application, such as logging, security, or transaction management. Instead of scattering these concerns across different parts of the code, AOP allows you to encapsulate them in separate components known as "aspects."

	* Key Concepts in Spring AOP
		1) Aspect: A module that encapsulates a cross-cutting concern.
		2) Join Point: A specific point in the execution of your program, such as a method execution or object creation.
		3) Advice: The action taken by an aspect at a specific join point. Examples include:
			a) Before Advice: Runs before the join point.
			b) After Advice: Runs after the join point.
			c) Around Advice: Runs before and after the join point, allowing more control.
		4) Pointcut: An expression that defines which join points an advice should apply to.
		5) Weaving: The process of linking aspects with other application types, either at compile time or runtime.
	
	* Example: Logging with AOP in Spring Boot
		Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide with code:
		1) Add Spring AOP dependency Add the following dependency in your pom.xml file:			
			<dependency>
				<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
				<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-aop</artifactId>
			</dependency>

				
		2) Create an Aspect Define an aspect for logging:		
			import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
			import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before;
			import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

			@Aspect
			@Component
			public class LoggingAspect {

				@Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
				public void logBeforeMethodExecution() {
					System.out.println("A method is being called in the service layer...");
				}
			}
			@Aspect: Marks the class as an aspect.
			@Before: Specifies that this advice should run before the method execution.
			Pointcut expression: execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..)) targets all methods in classes within the com.example.service package.
			
		3) Create a Service Class
			import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
			@Service
			public class MyService {
				public void performTask() {
					System.out.println("Performing the task...");
				}
			}
	
		4) Create a Spring Boot Main Application
			import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
			import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
			import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;

			@SpringBootApplication
			public class AopExampleApplication {

				public static void main(String[] args) {
					ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(AopExampleApplication.class, args);
					MyService myService = context.getBean(MyService.class);
					myService.performTask();
				}
			}

	* How It Works:
		- When the performTask method is called, the logBeforeMethodExecution advice runs first, logging a message before the actual method execution.
		- The output will look like:
			A method is being called in the service layer...
			Performing the task...

	* Key Benefits of AOP:
		1) Separation of Concerns: Isolate cross-cutting concerns like logging or security into separate aspects.
		2) Code Reusability: Centralize logic that would otherwise need to be duplicated in multiple places.
		3) Maintainability: Reduce clutter in your primary business logic by moving non-essential logic to aspects.
