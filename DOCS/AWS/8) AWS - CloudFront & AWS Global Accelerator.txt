AWS CloudFront
	* Content Delivery Network (CDN)
	* Improves read performance, content is cached at the edge
	* Improves users experience
	* 216 Point of Presence globally (edge locations)
	* DDoS protection (because worldwide), integration with Shield, AWS Web Application Firewall
	* (++++++++++ Image ++++++++++++)
	
CloudFront - Origins
	* S3 bucket 
		- For distributing files and caching them at the edge
		- For uploading files to S3 through CloudFront
		- Secured using Origin Access Control (OAC)
	
	* VPC Origin
		- For applications hosted in VPC private subnets
		- Application Load Balancer/Network Load Balancer/EC2 Instances
		
	* Custom Origin (HTTP)
		- S3 website (must first enable the bucket as a static S3 website)
		- Any public HTTP backend you want

CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication
	* CloudFront :
		- Global Edge Network
		- Files are cacked for a TTL(maybe a day)
		- Great for static content that must be available everywhere
	* S3 Cross Region Replication:
		- Must be setup for each region you want reaplication to happen
		- Files are updated in near real-time
		- Read only
		- Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions
		
CloudFront with S3 - Hands On
		
CloudFront - ALB or EC2 as an origin Using VPC Origins
	* Allows you to deliver content from your applications hosted in your VPC private subnets (no need to expose them on the Internet)
	* Deliver traffic to private:
		- Application Load Balancer
		- Network Load Balancer
		- EC2 Instances

CloudFront Geo Restriction
	* You can restict who can access your distribution
		- Allowlist : Allow your users to access your content only if they're in one of the countries on a list of approved countries.
		- Blocklist : Prevent your users from accessing your content if they're in one of the countries on a list of banned countries
	* The "country" is determined using a 3rd party Geo-IP database.
	* Use Case : Copyright Laws to control access to content.

CloudFront - Pricing
	* CloudFront Edge locations are all around the world
	* The cost of data out per edge location vary
	* (++++++++++ Image ++++++++++++)
	
CloudFront - Price Class
	* You can reduce the number of edge locations for cost reduction
	* Three price classes :
		- Price Class All : all regions - best performance
		- Price Class 200 : most regions, but excludes the most expensive regions
		- Price Class 100 : only the lease expensive regions

CloudFront - Cache Invalidations
	* In case you update the back-end origin, CloudFront doesn't know about it and will only get the regreshed contenct after the TTL has expired.
	* However, you can force an entire or partial cache refresh (thus bypassing the TTL) by performing a cloudFront Invalidation
	* You can invalidate all files(*) or a special path (/images/*)
